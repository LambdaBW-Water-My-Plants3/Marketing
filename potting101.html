        <h3>What’s the deal with soil? </h3>
        <p>Most plants need soil to live. It’s where their roots are and where they get their water from. But it may surprise you to learn that not all soil is soil. That is, although we see indoor plants potted in what looks like brown, soily, dirt, they
            may actually be potted in something else. Generally known in the horticulturist community as “potting mixes” or “artificial potting media”, this 1960’s invention has been in wide use since then for it’s lightweight, weed-free properties and
            its ability to sustain seemingly any plant. You may be thinking “why not just use outdoor soil for my indoor plants?” The truth is there are issues with that (see next paragraph), making artificial potting media superior. Allow us to explain.
            When soil is taken from outdoors to indoors, you’re taking in all the critters that live in that soil too — critters that would love to eat your plants. You also run the risk of tracking in a soil-borne disease that may kill your plant. On
            top of all that, outdoor soil is primarily composed of clay, sand, and silt which are not only quite heavy but also prone to congealing and hardening when they dry out completely. Doesn’t sound so great for your indoor plant, does it?</p>
        <h3>Breakdown by component</h3>
        <p>
            Peat — the basis of most mixes and used in high proportions. Spongy and holds water.<br> Perlite — white, light, pebbles formed from superheated volcanic glass. Aids in aeration and water control.<br> Sand — silicon dioxide. Aids in water
            drainage.
            <br> Vermiculite — helps hold water and provides a slow leak of micronutrients and places for fungi/microbes to aid the plants growth.<br> Wood chips/Bark — decaying organic matter that provides a slow release of macronutrients and is a “denser
            sponge” than peat. If cut coarse, can aid in drainage.<br> Compost — nutrient-rich and microbe rich matter that aids in plant growth. Smells earthy.<br> Glass/Rocks — cheap filler found in not-so-great mixes. Although the rocks could provide
            a trickle of micronutrients, their weight is enough to make them a lousy ingredient.
