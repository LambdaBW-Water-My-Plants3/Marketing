        <h3>Fertilization</h3>
        <p>Fertilization is the catalyst for growth, and light is the energy driver of growth. Both are needed for effective plant growth. If plants get leggy and pale, they may need more light. Plants that are not growing may need a combination of more
            fertilizer and light. It is recommended that you fertilize only during the growing season, although rare exceptions can be made for winter fertilization.</p>
        <h3>Seasonality</h3>
        <p>
            The most vigorous growth of plants will be in the summer when the sun is up and out the longest. From spring to fall is the growing season. During winter, the sun is neither as high in the sky, nor in the sky for as long as it is in the summer. For your
            plants, that means less light. For some plants, this may trigger dormancy. This is not to be confused with deciduousness though. Dormancy simply means non-growth. Deciduous plants lose their leaves in preparation for winter. Most houseplants
            are non-deciduous, however, due to the lack of light, your plants may drop a few leaves. This results from lack of light rather than deciduousness. If your plant drops a few leaves in winter, it is probably still alive.
