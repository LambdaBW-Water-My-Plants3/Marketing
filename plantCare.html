        <p>So your plant arrived in its nursery grow pot – now what? Read on to find out… When you bring your new plant home in its nursery grow pot, you might be tempted to pot it into a planter right away. However, you'll be more successful if you let
            your new plant acclimate to its new environment first. Why? It might sound strange to say about a plant but given the potential stress of acclimating to a new environment – adjusting to different light, levels of humidity, and temperature
            – you don’t want to unroot your plant at the same exact time. Think of its nursery pot as allowing it to staying safe in its original home for a while. So first, place your plant in the spot you plan to keep it and let it acclimate for about
            2 weeks. (If it’s the start or peak of the spring-summer growing season, you can shave off a few of those days to get it in a new planter sooner. More on that below.) After this adjustment period, you can decide to leave as is or fully pot
            it into a decorative planter. Remember, potting a plant early on is optional: as long as it looks happy and healthy, you don’t need to lift a finger! We break down different plant parent preferences below, and what to look when assessing if
            it’s time to pot your plant.</p>
        <h3>How to pot your plant</h3>

            When the time comes to move your plant from its nursery grow pot into its earthenware planter, here's what you'll want handy in addition to your plant and planter - Fresh potting mixand a Lava rocks or similar, if your planter does not have.A drainage
            hole We carry apartment-friendly sized bags of indoor potting mixes, as well as lava rocks, here. Or use your favorite all-purpose indoor potting soil for houseplants and container gardens. River rocks or gravel can be substituted for lava
            rocks. Essentially you’re looking for something to create crevices at the bottom of the planter for excess water to pool into, away from the plant’s roots. Now that you have your supplies, here’s the steps you need to take to move your plant
            from its grow pot into its earthenware planter. (Prefer a visual? Watch our plant expert go through the motions here!)
