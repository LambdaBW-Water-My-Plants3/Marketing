        <h2>How our app combats climate change</h2>
        <p>There are many causes for climate change, and excess use of water doesn't have a huge impact on the climate crisis, however it does have an impact and we want to lessen that as much as possible. Our app aims to provide plant lovers with a convenient method to track watering their plants, so you will have healthy beautiful plants and not use excess water. By using our app you will know exacly how much water to use, so you will make an impact on climate change and in your garden. In some places in the world, climate change is impacting populations water supply negatively. Wether that be due to the unpredictable weather, or droughts peoples access to water is being directly effected. Due to this increased demand for the transportation of water, we are seeing an increase in energy-intensive pumping, treatment and transportation, thereby raising carbon emmissions and exacerbating climate change.

        <h2>How you can continue the fight</h2>
        <p>The climate crisis we face today is the biggest threat humans have had to face. It has the potiential to lead us to extintion, and it requires swift action from all of us to lessen the damge it will cause. Although you can make an impact alone, to solve the climate crisis requires action from all of us, especially our leaders and represenatives. Be sure to talk to your family and friends, but more importantly contact your representatives to take action. If possible, choose a utily company that generates at least half its power from renewable sources, or if that isn't possible take a look at your electric bill to see if there is other ways to support renewable sources. Be sure to invenst in energy-effecient appliances, as this is the lowest-cost method to reduce your carbon footprint. Just as our app aims to conserve water use, you can also take shorter showers and not run your tap as you brush your teeth. Agriculture is estimated to contribute 20-25% of glabal annual emmisions, and a large portion of that is due to the meat industry. Be sure not to waste your food, as 40% off the food in the U.S. ends up in the landfill, and cut down on meat. Be sure to recyle whenever possible, and donate your old clothes to a local thrift store.
